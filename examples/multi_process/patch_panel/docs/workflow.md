SPP Workflow

Initially SPP added as sample application for DPDK.
In long run it is possible to separate it and use DPDK as library.

There are two main branches:

* dpdk branch: dpdk.org/master tracking branch.
  This branch merged into master branch regularly.

* mater branch: spp development branch.

For each DPDK release, spp release is tagged in the spp repo.
Master branch has latest development DPDK and SPP codes.
